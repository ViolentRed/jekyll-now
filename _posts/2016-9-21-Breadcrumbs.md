Huraah! Via the amazing detective skills of Google I've managed to find easier ways to install the needed tools to really customize this blog! So two big thanks to https://chocolatey.org/ and http://jwillmer.de/blog/tutorial/how-to-install-jekyll-and-pages-gem-on-windows-10-x46#github-pages-and-plugins. THANK YOU SO SO MUCH FOR THESE WONDERFUL TOOLS. I don't understand them %100 yet but the hope of this blog is that someday I will!
